            <p class="text">Marvel Comics is the brand name and primary imprint of Marvel Worldwide Inc., formerly
                Marvel Publishing,
                Inc. and Marvel Comics Group, a publisher of American comic books and related media. In 2009, The Walt
                Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment, Marvel Worldwide's parent company.

                Marvel was started in 1939 by Martin Goodman under a number of corporations and imprints but now known
                as Timely Comics,[2] and by 1951 had generally become known as Atlas Comics. The Marvel era began in
                1961, the year that the company launched The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles created by Stan
                Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and many others. The Marvel brand, which had been used over the years, was
                solidified as the company's primary brand.

                Marvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Spider-Man, Ant-Man, Iron Man, Thor,
                the Hulk, Captain America, the Wasp, Wolverine, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, Ghost
                Rider, Blade, Daredevil and the Punisher. Superhero teams exist such as the Avengers, the X-Men, the
                Fantastic Four and the Guardians of the Galaxy as well as supervillains including Doctor Doom, Magneto,
                Thanos, Ultron, Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Red Skull, Loki, Venom, Dormammu, Galactus, and Kingpin.
                Most of Marvel's fictional characters operate in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe, with
                most locations mirroring real-life places; many major characters are based in New York City.</p>
